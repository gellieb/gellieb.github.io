  <h2>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
  <h4>December 17, 2014</h4>

      I completely appreciate how passionate Shereef is about DBC. He described it as an experiment, but stated that what you get from it is essentially based on your mindset. I agree with his analogy of the restaurant vs table approach was interesting.

      As a student enrolled at DBC, I can lean back and let the information and learning come to me, as if I were a consumer at a restaurant. But I could also take the reins on my education and future, actively partaking and absorbing what this program has to offer. The latter is the approach I have. I want to be in control of my own growth. I love that DBC is all about this attitude because it's the kind of perspective that inspires not only you but those around you to go beyond the preconceived notions and barriers set upon ourselves.

      Finishing up the first week of Phase 0, I'm filled with a sense of nervousness and excitement! We've only dipped our toe in the water, but I'm excited to jump in.
