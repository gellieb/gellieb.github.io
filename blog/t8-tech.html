      <div class="title"><h1>SQL Injections</h1><h2>February 15, 2015</h2></div>

      <p class="text"> So this week, our language de la semaine was SQL. It's not complex at all. The data in a database is like a full service and ginormous library. SQL, the librarian, looks for and retrieves exactly what you're looking for. SQL statements like <code>SELECT * FROM table-name</code> seem straightforward-- this one means to retrieve all the info from a table called "table-name". Simple.
      <br><br>
      However, malicious users can use SQL against us and databases using SQL injections. Using SQL injections, conniving hackers can retrieve ID's and their passwords!
      <br><br>
      So, what are SQL injections?<br><br>
      First off, to recap on what SQL does relative to us: SQL is used to display data on a webpage and it is common to let web users to input their own search values. Think: using a search engine, or looking for Joe Shmo in the Facebook's search box, or even putting in your username for your bank.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;</code></pre>
      <p class="text"> This is an example of a SQL statement. This one, in particular, creates a select statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to select a string. The variable is fetched from the user input (Request for user ID) to the page.
        <br><br>
      A SQL injection is a technique where bastardly hacking hackers can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement, which would alter it and compromise the security of a web app.
      <br>
      Based on our example, the purpose of the code was to select a user with the inputted user ID. But nothing is stopping that hacker from entering something conniving like this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1</code></pre>
      <p class="text"> Now, this statement is totally valid. It seems innocuous... but because it's based on the condition <code>WHERE 1=1</code>, it will return all the rows from the table Users.
      <br><br>
      Eh.. seem dangerous yet?<br><br>
      That statement is the same thing as saying this: </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>SELECT UserId, Name, Password FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1</code></pre>

      <p class="text"> Oh crap....
      Now some asshole's got all of your personal information!!! <br><br>
      The danger in SQL injections is that they are based on the condition where <code>"="</code> is ALWAYS TRUE! Even using a statement like this: <code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""=""</code> is totally valid and may give a hacker access to user names and passwords.
      <br><br>
      Now, the other pitfall of SQL injections: batched SQL statements!
      <br><br>
      Most databases support batched SQL statements, statements separated by a semicolon. That, in itself, isn't that bad; in fact, it's convenient. However, those clever bastards can also use this capability of supporting batched SQL statements to input this:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers</code></pre>
      <p class="text"> Now look what they did! They have all your info AND DELETED the table too!<br><br>

      Catch your breath. Don't freak out. <br>Web developers recognize this giant gaping hole and have parameters for protection. Let's start out with one you may think would work, (but actually does diddly squat.)<br><br>

      Let's blacklist some words! Yea! Blacklist those quotes, semicolons, and equal signs, even words like DELETE and DROP to prevent SQL injection attacks. This actually doesn't work so well.<br>
      The words and characters are commonly used in our language so we HAVE to allow their use in the input.
      So, the only proven way to protect a web site from SQL injection attacks is to use SQL parameters.<br><br>
      SQL parameters are values that are added in a controlled manner to a SQL query at execution time (when you input your user ID/password).<br>This is the updated version of the SQL query from our initial example.
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
txtCit = getRequestString("City");
txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtNam,txtAdd,txtCit)</code></pre>
  <p class="text">SQL parameters are prefixed by a <code>@</code>. The SQL engine checks each listed parameter to make sure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, rather than a statement to be executed.<br><br>

  As one of the web's biggest vulnerabilities, parameterized queries are used far and wide in web languages. Use parameters. Avoid losing your information.</p>
