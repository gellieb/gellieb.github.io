      <div class="title"><h1>Pair Programming and Feedback</h1><h2>January 25, 2015</h2></div>

      <p class="text"> One of the core features of DBC is pair programming, a learning style in which two programmers collaborate on a project or challenge. One person drives -- writes code-- while the other navigates-- guides and reviews the code. During Phase 0, most of, if not all, of our pairing sessions are done remotely via Skype, Google+ and Google Hangouts. In addition to working on a challenge together, the real challenge, I felt, laid in communicating clearly and effectively since we wouldn't be able to rely on body cues or simply pointing to the line of code we were referencing. </p>
<br>
      <p class="text"> At the start of Phase 0, I can honestly say that I did not look forward to pairing. I had spent the last few months learning to program mostly independently and though I didn't mind working with someone else, I preferred going it alone. But mostly, I was filled with doubts about myself and my skill. What if I was totally lost and couldn't express myself clearly? Would my pair feel like I was dragging them down? Normally, I would pore over research until I got the solution, but would that be okay here? Would they look down on me because I didn't know? Moreover, after each session we would have to submit anonymous feedback for our pairs. Ah, now we'd be graded by our peers too? Sigh, I felt very self-conscious.</p><br>
      <p class ="text">But my fears weren't realized. These pairing sessions turned out to be one of the highlights of Phase 0. Sure we couldn't work together in person and sometimes our skill level was uneven, but it was a time when we could be open and ask each other questions and revel in our collaborative successes. Sometimes, I would completely overthink an approach, but my pair would come up with something brilliant and even better. I loved the fresh perspective I would get. Even when my pair wasn't sure of a concept, it was an opportunity to ground out the weaknesses and holes I had. Best of all, I made some great friends and felt okay to be vulnerable.</p>
<br>
      <p class="text"> After my first couple pairing sessions, I was eager to get my feedback. Was I too anal about a concept? Did I come off too aggressively? We had to submit feedback through DBC's Feedbackinator. It would take a few days to receive our own because they underwent a peer review process to see if they were actionable, specific and kind. Kind has an element of truth that distinguishes itself from niceness.</p>
<br>
      <p class="text">In preparation for this blog post, I went through all of my feedback charting the positive and critical ones. I was taken aback by how genuinely nice some of the feedback were. However, the critical pieces were the ones I agreed on. I knew my faults already. I can be a little impatient, tend to rush without fully explaining every detail of my approach, and fall silent when at an impasse. Reading these made me nod my head in agreement. Perhaps if I didn't schedule some of my sessions before work, I wouldn't feel so rushed? They make me want to improve myself and my approach. Good communication. Patience. These are attributes that are vital to my career as well as building strong relationships.</p><br>

      <p class="text">Writing feedback proved to be a tougher than reading them. Making sure that what I critiqued was actionable and specific took more thought. I check out how others perceive my feedback through Meta Feedback. Sometimes people felt it wasn't specific or actionable enough; other times, they were. However, the more feedback I give, the easier it's becoming. I look forward to pairing more often with my peers to see how much we all grow from this experience.</p>
