      <p class="text">"Why do you not want to go to medical school?" <br><br>
      It was a question that my mom posed to me trying to ascertain why after 5 years of undergrad with a major in Biology with specializations in Neuroscience and Genetics, 2 years of interning and taking the MCATS-- that, all of sudden, I didn't want to do it anymore. And of all things, go into web development. As my mother, I understand her need to understand why after so much effort and being so close to going to medical school, I suddenly changed my mind. <br><br>
      To her it may have felt sudden, but I think I had been internally asking myself that question most of 2014. The reasons were many: I don't want to spend 10+ years of my life cramming and stressing about taking test after test after test; I don't want to finally conclude those years and have a minimum of $200,000 in debt; what if I change my mind after a year and have to continue because how can I look for another career/profession with so much financial baggage??; what if I don't have what it takes to hack it? Do I want to put myself through this? Ugh...
      <br>
      Just reliving that internal turmoil makes me somber. I had thought that concluding to myself that medicine wasn't the path for me marked an end to that...doubt. That introspection. <br><br>But when my mom asked me that question, I remember being filled with anger.  How could she not understand me? Doesn't she know I didn't come to this decision easily? Why doesn't she understand that this is my decision, not hers? I fell silent. My eyes welled up with tears-- how I normally get when I'm so frustrated....
      <br><br>
      I don't think I was angry, per se. It was just that that internal grappling was externalized and in my face, but I still didn't have a definite reason why I didn't want to go to medical school. All the reasons and rationalizing I was telling myself didn't seem very significant enough to express. Weren't these all negative aspects still valid even when I DID pursue the field?
      <br> <br>I think I felt foolish, for not realizing this earlier. Years earlier. However, I know that even now I appreciate all the years spent learning about the brain and anatomy and genetics... I loved those years. I felt foolish for not considering the reality of these questions earlier.<br><br>
      I felt lost. And scared. I was giving up something I know, something I'd been a student of for years in exchange for a field I know hardly anything about. I'm 25. Not 15. I shouldn't be changing my mind so frivolously. I didn't know if this were the right decision. Would web development/software development/programming/whatever-the-heck-you-call-it-omg-I-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it be right for me?
      <br><br>
      I still feel a lot of the uncertainty, the doubt and internal conflict. It's in the back of my mind and comes out when I'm stressed out...like I was when I had to make a game out of thin air, when I'd learned JavaScript for all of 3 days. Ah.
      <br><br>
      The fear and uncertainty is real. However it'll always be there. In hindsight, I would tell myself, not to worry so much. I am happier now than when I was cramming for the MCATS, pulling all-nighters night after night. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish my assignments, learn a new language, etc. Sure, it would've made a lot more sense had I realized med school wasn't for me and taken some computer science classes. I would've had an earlier start. But life filled with coulda, shoulda, wouldas, but there's no need to dwell on it. In hindsight, I would tell myself to talk to my parents more. I'm sure they were worrying about the questions I had been worrying about for all 8+ years I'd said I was pursuing medicine. Maybe if I'd talked my thoughts and fears aloud, I wouldn't have felt like my life was so off-track and lost, but would've approached it with more clarity.<br><br>
