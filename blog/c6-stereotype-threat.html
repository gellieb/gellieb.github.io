      <div class="title"><h1>Stereotype threat getting you down?</h1><h2>February 2, 2015</h2></div>

      <p class="text">Is perception of your gender, ethnicity, religion and/or sexual orientation holding you back from reaching your full potential? Acclaimed social psychologist, Dr. Claude Steele, coined the term, "stereotype threat" to describe the phenomenon amongst underrepresented groups. Stereotype threat is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or fear of inadvertently confirming that stereotype. Furthermore, the more you care about doing well in that situation, the more that stereotype is going to upset and disturb you. The prospect of confirming a stereotype is enough to undermine a person's performance even if he/she is fully prepared.
      <br>
      Everyone experiences stereotype threat in some way because every society is negatively stereotyped by another. And when we're in the environment in which these stereotypes apply, we experience them too.<br>
      Steele conducted several experiments to assess standardized test performances to manipulate the effects of stereotype threat. In one study, he asked two groups of Black and white college students to take a 30-minute test made of questions from the GRE. When one group was told that the test would assess their intellectual ability, Black students underperformed dramatically. The second group, on the other hand, was told explicitly that the test could not measure intellectual ability; both Black and white students performed virtually at the same level. The small instruction that the test wasn't a test of cognitive ability, was all it took to make the stereotype irrelevant.
      <br>
      Steele said the stereotype threat causes a physiological effect in addition to a psychological one. Under the threat, anxiety manifests itself by distraction, increased body temperature and heart rate, all of which undermine performance levels.<br>
      As a female Asian American, a double minority, I have grown up with plenty of stereotypes. Of them, one stands out.
      <br>Women can't understand math and science the way that men can/Women don't have the capacity to understand STEM.<br>
       Oh.. this one makes my blood boil. In hindsight, this was probably one of the stereotypes I wanted to crush by pursuing medicine. Now, of course, that chapter in my life has closed but I'm still pursuing the computer science field, which has an even greater bias against women. Especially after researching the gender diversity gap in technology, I am worried that I'll be labelled lesser because of my being a female.
       <br>
       Dr. Steele's studies revealed that everyone is vulnerable to stereotype threat. However, we can reduce the effects. Remind yourself that performance is not tied to your gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation nor to anyone's overly generalized and simplified notion. You are you. You don't represent thousands of people nor do thousands of people represent you. Stereotypes are relics of the past that need to be swept away. Surround yourself with like-minded people, mentors, and role-models. Be in an enviroment that fosters growth and creativity, not one that shackles you to others' misconceptions.
