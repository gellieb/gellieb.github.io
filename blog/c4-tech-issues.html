      <div class="title"><h1>Closing the Gender Gap</h1><h2>January 18, 2015</h2></div>

      <p class="text"> As a woman, one of the first problems I face is the lack of diversity, specifically gender diversity. I come from a medical background so I feel like I traded one male-dominated field for another. However, though medicine has made great strides with the numbers of female doctors, nurses, and medical practitioners steadily increasing each year, the tech/computer science/engineering industry seems like it's in the technological stone age--averaging around 15-20% women in its tech field, or possibly even the commendable and outlier 40%. </p>

      <p class="text">With even tech titans like Apple, Google, and Facebook falling into this abysmal statistical category -- yea, this gender gap is a pretty big deal.
        <br>
        <br>
      So why is gender diversity a problem? Well, at the core, the primary problem of the lack of gender diversity is the lack of diversity itself! In ideas, in perspectives? Missing representation of almost 50% of the world's population because of lack of diversity is quite sad. How is technology supposed to advance from its current state if all it's doing is repeating its previous ideas in carefully marketed forms to disguise its inherent iteration?
      <br>
      <br>
      Women are screened from interviews because of their gender. If not their gender, they're over- or under-qualified, or she is "not a culture fit." -- I had to look this last one up because the term kept popping up in blogs and articles I was researching.
      <br>
      Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/shanley">Shanley Kane</a> in a Q&A with FastCo. Labs broke it down how it <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3016238/why-your-startups-culture-is-secretly-awful">disproportionately affects women in tech</a>:
      <br>
      <br>
      <quote>This idea that someone is not a culture fit functions both during the hiring process and when people are already in the company. I know a number of women who have been turned down from jobs because they “weren't a culture fit.” I know a lot of people, not just women, but it seems that women are disproportionally affected. “Not a culture fit” is used as a reason to turn people down for a job. Once they are there, it's a way of kicking them out of the culture.
      <br>
      <br>
      People will say “not a culture fit” without having to define what that means. It's almost this sacred space which lets them uncritically reject people from the company or from the team. On the surface level it tends to mean “We just don't like you. You're different from us. We don't want to figure out how to work with you.” “Not a culture fit” gives us a really easy way to disregard your experience and you as a person.</quote>
      <br>
      However, simply hiring more women isn't the answer. Companies that supposedly "support" female programmers hire them primarily for entry-level jobs. Or, in another more common instance, companies "window-dress." There'll be one woman in a group of males, but it turns out she's in marketing. There are so many reasons why there aren't more women in tech. <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631">Valleywag collected anecdotal answers and comments</a> to this question.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>So where does this problem stem from and how do we mitigate it?</h3>
      <br>
      <div id="stat"><a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/chart-bad-gender-gap-tech-companies/"><img src="../imgs/why-women-leave-stat.png"/></a></div>
      <br>
      <p class="text">
      In the workplace, Harvard Business School study on women in the science, technology, and engineering workforce found that 56% of women left the tech industry attributing to hostile work environments, "brogrammer" culture, and insufficient compensation. Moreover, a 2011 study found that 20% of women who graduated with an engineering degree did not continue to work in engineering, while another 20% entered the field before leaving for another industry.
      <br>
      <br>
      I think it's mostly the attitude and stigma against female programmers that needs to change. If you read some of the <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631">anecdotes</a> aforementioned, this male superiority complex is deeply engrained in college peers as well as some CS professors and may have been instilled, perhaps, much earlier.
      <br>
      <br>
      Addressing a question about the gender gap during a Seattle Rotary panel in August 2014, Sarah Bird, the CEO of Moz said, "There isn't a simple solution to this. If there was, we would have figured it out, because there's definitely a will." Like her, most other CEOs and tech in-the-knows point to a reform in education and exposure to computer science at an early age.</p>

      <p class="text">
      Over the past decades, numerous organizations in the computer science community are making waves in computer science education in public schools. Programs like <a href="http://www.tealsk12.org/">TEALS</a> (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools)'s grassroots and <a href="http://code.org/">Code.org</a> push to expand access in urban schools systems, especially in elementary and middle schools as well as more ethnically diverse and urban districts. Campaigns like Microsoft's <a href="http://www.wespeakcode.net/">We Speak Code</a> and Google's <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made With Code</a> have also raised awareness in mainstream. Likewise, there are nonprofits, such as <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/">NCWIT</a>, the <a href= "http://anitaborg.org/">Anita Borg Institute</a>, <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>, <a href="http://codenow.org/">CodeNow</a>, exclusively focusing on the diversity problem. Hundreds of organizations joined <a href="http://hourofcode.com/us">Hour of Code</a>, a grassroots campaign, introduce students worldwise to one hour of computer science to break the stigma that coding is only for nerds. The collective effort amassed 40 million students to try an Hour of Code, exposing more girls to computer science in 2013 than in the last 70 years!
      <br><br>
      It's going to take time and cooperation since the solution is breaking the stereotype and rebuilding the face of computer science from inside out, but change is happening.
