  <h2>Version control and tracking changes</h2>

      Git is a downloadable system that keeps track of changes to a project and creates one base form reflecting all of the changes. It’s a great way to collaborate with people from all over the world and share versions of files with one another. Git will log all of the changes made and who they were done by and continually update to reflect changes made to the project in real-time. It also lives locally in your computer.

    <p>
      Git also let you create and work on parallel universes of projects called branches. While you can have multiple branches of a project, there will be one which houses the perfect version of the project. You can keep the perfect one and throw everything away, if you’d like.
      The major difference between git and Github is that git is completely local, or within your computer, whereas Github is a website and remote. You will not be able to access your files remotely, or from a different computer, unless you make them remote by uploading them to Github.

      Version control keeps a running tally of all the changes made to a project. You can always go to previously unchanged version of your project if something goes awry with a change you made. Each change, no matter how small, is called a “commit.”

      Github is a social coding network. Developers can share code and track changes using git. Without version control, developers wouldn’t be able to openly share code because if multiple people overwrite a file or delete a portion of it, there wouldn’t be useful code anymore. Version control would allow developers to openly share code with the knowledge that there is an ultimate and controllable ctrl-z for any mistakes made.
