  <h2>What is Github and version control?</h2>

      Github is a downloadable system that keeps track of changes to a project and creates one base form reflecting all of the changes. It’s a great way to collaborate with people from all over the world and share versions of files with one another. So... it is simply a social coding network.
      Version control keeps a running tally of all the changes made to a project. You can always go to previously unchanged version of your project if something goes awry with a change you made. Each change, no matter how small, is called a “commit.”
      Developers can share code and track changes using git. Without version control, developers wouldn’t be able to openly share code because if multiple people overwrite a file or delete a portion of it, there wouldn’t be useful code anymore. Version control would allow developers to openly share code with the knowledge that there is an ultimate and controllable ctrl-z for any mistakes made.
