        Everybody has his own way of thinking and intaking stimuli and input from his surroundings. Rather than being a singular exact style, it can be a blend of four different styles. Anthony Gregorc's Mind Styles Model provides an organized way to consider how our minds think based on our answering 15 questions. The model is broken down into 2 primary perceptual qualities (concrete and abstract) which is further subdivided into 2 ordering abilities(sequential and random), totaling 4 different thinking styles.
        <br><br>
        1. Concrete Sequential (CS)<br>
        2. Abstract Random (AR)<br>
        3. Abstract Sequential (AS)<br>
        4. Concrete Random (CR)

        I am definitely a concrete thinker: I scored nearly the same in both Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random thinking styles. Concrete sequential thinkers like order, logical sequences, following directions and getting facts. They learn best in structured environments, generally work pragmatically, and have a linear thought process. Concrete random thinkers, on the other hand, like experimenting to find answers, working independently and competitively. In contrast to the concrete sequential approach, concrete random thinkers' minds organize information by chunk, in no particular order, and are much more intuitive and impulsive than planned.

        I am actually amazed at this information. I feel it describes me with my artistic and scientific backgrounds very well. Even though both styles are quite distinctive, they complement each other very well. At DBC, I plan on maximizing the strengths of both. Generally as a concrete thinker, I learn best when taking a hands-on approach. I work well in teams as well as independently, so I look forward to pair programming and group challenges, but ultimately furthering my developer career. If you want to determine your thinking styles check out <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregoric's personality test</a> and <a href="
        http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">SUNY Cortland's article</a> on apply this newfound information.

        Although, I have the pragmatic approach well developed, I know I am not the most abstract thinker. But not all hope is lost. According to Carol Dweck's research on <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth and fixed mindsets</a>, growth mindsets, unlike fixed ones, thrive on challenges as opportunities for growth and aren't afraid of failure. Fixed mindsets, on the other hand, perceive one's intelligence and capabilites as inherited and unchangeable and avoid risking failure. Similiar to thinking styles, mindsets aren't set in stone and aren't the same in all areas. In some, I may be more fixed than in others. However, I will strive to have more open-mindedness in all areas and tasks while at DBC and beyond. Failure is inevitable and is a marker of your progress rather than a hindrance.
